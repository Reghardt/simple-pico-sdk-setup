Go to: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk
Clone Pico SDK to a folder, ie ~/Documents/Development/Pico/pico-sdk

Create a folder for a pico project
Create a file called CMakeLists.txt
Copy this into file CMakeLists.txt (from same github link as above, under 2. "Or with the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK as a submodule"):
```
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)

    include("../pico-sdk/pico_sdk_init.cmake") # relative path to pico-sdk

    project(my_project CXX C ASM)

    # initialize the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
    pico_sdk_init()

    # rest of your project
    add_executable(hello_world
        hello_world.c
    )

    # Add pico_stdlib library which aggregates commonly used features
    target_link_libraries(hello_world pico_stdlib)

    # create map/bin/hex/uf2 file in addition to ELF.
    pico_add_extra_outputs(hello_world)
```

Press Ctrl Shift P and run "c/c++: Edit Configuration
Add "~/Documents/Development/Pico/pico-sdk/**" to includePath array. It should be the absolute path pointing to the pico sdk

Run mkdir -p build && cd build && ls && cmake .. && make hello_world
The build folder will be created and populated with output from the pico sdk, including a uf2 file.
Copy uf2 file to pico


POTENTIAL ISSUES:
Error:
CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "Unix Makefiles". CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM is not set. You probably need to select a different build tool.
Solve:
sudo pacman -S base-devel


Error:
CMake Error: Error required internal CMake variable not set, cmake may not be built correctly.
Missing variable is:
CMAKE_ASM_COMPILE_OBJECT
...... many such lines
